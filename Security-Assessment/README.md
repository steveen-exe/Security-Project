## 🔍 Assessment Overview

**Objective**: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities across:

* Network infrastructure
* Application security
* Compliance controls
* Data protection mechanisms

**Scope**: Internal and perimeter network ranges, selected web applications, and key infrastructure services (AD, file servers, perimeter devices).

**Methodology**:

## 🛡️ Key Assessment Areas

| Area             | Tool      | Target         | Critical Findings |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Network Security | Nmap      | 192.168.1.0/24 | 3 open RDP ports  |
|                  | Wireshark | DMZ traffic    | Unencrypted FTP   |
|                  | Nessus    | All hosts      | CVE-2023-1234     |

## 2. Compliance Checks

| Standard | Controls Assessed | Pass Rate |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| PCI-DSS  | 12/12             | 92%       |
| GDPR     | 8/10              | 80%       |

## 3. 📊 Risk Matrix

| Vulnerability        | CVSS | Impact   | Likelihood | Status        |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Unpatched WS2019     | 9.1  | Critical | High       | 🟡 Mitigating |
| Weak Password Policy | 7.5  | High     | Medium     | 🔴 Open       |

---

## 4. 🛠️ Remediation Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (0–7 days)

* Patch critical CVEs (KB5034441)
* Disable legacy protocols (FTP, SMBv1)
* Block exposed RDP at the perimeter or enable MFA + gateway
* Verify backups and snapshot consistency for critical hosts

### Mid-Term (8–30 days)

```powershell
# Enforce LAPS for local admin passwords
Set-AdmPwdPasswordPolicy -Identity "Default Domain Policy" -MinPasswordLength 14
# Example: review & apply baseline GPOs, enable SMB signing, and disable NTLM where possible
```

### Long-Term (30+ days)

* Implement WAF (ModSecurity rules) in front of public web applications
* Deploy centralized logging & SIEM correlation (ELK/Wazuh/Elastic SIEM)
* Conduct purple-team exercises and tabletop incident response
* Formalize patch & vulnerability management lifecycle

docker run -it --rm owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://target.com -r zap_report.html
```

Notes: Replace `https://target.com` and IP ranges with scope-approved targets only.
